# 🚀 NLP Projects Repository  

This repository contains a collection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects covering various modern approaches in natural language processing and modeling. All projects are designed to explore, implement, and evaluate NLP techniques from basic to advanced levels.

## 🎯 Main Focus  
Each project in this repository relates to one or more of the following aspects:  

- 🔹 **Text Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
  Tokenization, normalization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and text transformation.  

- 🔹 **Text Representation**  
  TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and contextual embeddings (BERT, Sentence Transformers, etc.).  

- 🔹 **Deep Learning for NLP**  
  Utilizing Transformer architectures, LLMs, and fine-tuning pre-trained models for various NLP tasks.  

- 🔹 **NLP Tasks & Applications**  
  Including (but not limited to):  
  - Text Classification  
  - Sentiment Analysis  
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
  - Topic Modeling  
  - Information Retrieval  
  - Question Answering  
  - Document Understanding  

- 🔹 **AI & LLM Integration**  
  Experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and AI-powered text processing.  

## 🧠 Repository Goals  
This repository aims to:  
- Serve as a technical portfolio in the NLP field  
- Document experiments and learning progress  
- Provide real-world implementation references  
- Demonstrate the application of NLP theory into practical solutions
